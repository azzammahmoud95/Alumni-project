# Alumni Project.

Proposal
This project is a personal portfolio website for Elie Azar, he is a Full-Stack web
developer at basma.com. He needs a personal portfolio because he is lacking
of job offers and of digital exposure and he needs a portfolio to increase his
views and let people know more about him. His target people will be his
concerned customers in his projects and people who are interested in him.
The target goal of this project is to increase productivity. This website includes
landing pages where we can find a header and a toolbar that also contains
three animated titles, a description, a button, and also an animated
background, going to the about page includes three animated icons and each
icon leads us to a different page the first one leads you to skills the second
one is to projects and the third to contact, going to the project page we have
listed cards as projects each card has(image, title, description, and link), and
as an admin, he wants to CRUD(create, read, update, delete), the skills and
projects. Considering the projects page includes 4 to 5 skills only and each
one of them contains (a title, description, and a small button to navigate
between skills ) it should be animated. The contact us page includes a form
and the form fields are (Full name, email, and message). The two last pages
are the login page for the admin and a dashboard for the skills part as we said
before and as an admin, he wants to be able to receive messages either from
his inbox or doing a table of emails inside the dashboard.
